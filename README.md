<h2 align="center" id="aboutMe">Few things about me</h2><br/>
<br/>


<h3>Who am I ?</h3>
<br/>


My name is <b>Florian Boireau</b>, I'm french and I'm from 1999. <br/>
I'm born near Rouen, Normandy (76), I used to leave here but i moved for my studies, first I moved to Le Havre for 3 years and then I moved to Cannes for 2 years to do my master (and maybe meet Leonardo DiCaprio, <em>I write this 2 years after, it did not happened sadly</em>).<br/>
I'm a developer, I wrote in many languages, most of my studies projects are not here du to computer loss but now i'm specialized in game development.<br/>
<br/>


<h3>What are my diplomas ?</h3>
<br/>


I have few diplomas :

   <ul>
     <li>A STI2D <b>BaccalaurÃ©at</b> (BTEC National Diploma) with highest honors</li>
     <li>An IT <b>DUT</b> (Technical Bachelor Degree)</li>
     <li>An IT <b>Licence</b> (Bachelor Degree) <i>magna cum laude</i></li>
     <li>A Master Degree in video game development and management</li>
   </ul>
<br/>

   
<h3>Do I have hobbies ?</h3>
<br/>


I love technologies and History, I can spend hours reading about an historical detail, I'm really interested by wars and the reason behind their beginnings.<br/>
I have a sentence that I love to say about History : "By knowing little lines of the past, you know big lines of the future". I don't know if I made it or heard it but I find it really deep and realistic.<br/>
<br/>


<h3>What are my favorite video games ?</h3>
<br/>


As a game developer, I love video games and my favorites are :
 
 <ul>
   <li>World Of Warcraft</li>
   <li>Stellaris</li>
   <li>Crusader Kings</li>
   <li>Fallout New Vegas</i></li>
   <li>Final Fantasy XV</li>
   <li>Halo 3 (Or Reach, choice is too hard)</li>
   <li>Rimworld</li>
   <li>Dragon Quest 9 (nostalgia I suppose)</li>
</ul>
<br/>


<h3>Do I have dreams ?</h3>
<br/>


I have a lot of dreams, I want to live abroad to know new things, new cultures, new peoples but the most important is culinary specialties !<br/>
I want a dog too, for some people it's already a reality but i had cat all my life while I always prefered dogs ðŸ˜– <br/>
<br/>


<h3>What I want to do in the future ?</h3>
<br/>


In programming, I love Oriented Object Programming languages, I found them really fun and pleasant to read and write. I've mainly done student project with OOP or web languages for now, I still don't have "real games" here, I've done few "games" with Java or Unity, but they're not really something I should call "games" (Except Towards The Unknown). I learn Unity and in a close future, I will try Unreal Engine to understand both of them.<br/>
Also I'm a fond of project. I really like team working, team building and everything that rely on communications.<br/>
<br/>
